# 🛡️ ARP Spoofing Detection Dashboard

## What is ARP? What is ARP Spoofing?

**Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** is a fundamental protocol in computer networks that maps IP addresses to physical MAC addresses, allowing devices to communicate within a local network. However, ARP is inherently insecure and susceptible to attacks.

**ARP Spoofing** (or ARP Poisoning) is a cyberattack where a malicious actor sends fake ARP messages onto a network. This tricks devices into associating the attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of another device (such as the gateway), enabling the attacker to intercept, modify, or block network traffic. ARP spoofing is a common technique used in Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks and can lead to data theft, session hijacking, or denial of service.

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive, interactive dashboard for detecting ARP spoofing attacks using machine learning. Built with Streamlit, it enables:

- **Data exploration and visualization**
- **Training and evaluation of multiple ML models**
- **Real-time predictions on custom network data**
- **Side-by-side model comparison**

The dashboard is designed for network engineers, security researchers, students, and anyone interested in network security and ML.
